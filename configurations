[Data]
*Two well-known datasets Twitter15,Twitter16, complied by Ma et al. (2017)
Jing Ma, Wei Gao, and Kam Fai Wong. 2017. Detect rumors in microblog posts using propagation structure
via kernel learning. In ACL 2017 - 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, Proceedings of the Conference,)

*Each dataset contains a collection of source tweets, along with their corresponding sequences of retweet users.
*We choose only “true” and “fake” labels as the ground truth.
*we use user IDs to crawl user information via Twitter API.
